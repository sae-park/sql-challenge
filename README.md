This project involves the analysis of employee data from Pewlett Hackard, focusing on employees from the 1980s and 1990s. The data is derived from six CSV files that serve as the foundation for building a SQL database. 

1. Data Modeling
   - Inspected the CSV files to understand the data structure
   - Created an ERD to represent relationships between tables
     
2. Data Engineering
   - Designed table schemas for each of the six csv files
   - Created SQL tables in the correct order to maintain foreign key relationships
   - Imported data from csv files into the corresponding SQL tables
     
3. Data Analysis
   - Executed SQL queries to extract and analyze data, including:
      Employee details (number, last name, first name, sex, salary).
      Employees hired in 1986.
      Department managers and their details.
      Employee counts by last name.
      Specific employee information from the Sales and Development departments.

In the EmployeesSQL folder is a screenshot of the ERD, queries, and schemas.
